# DiscordTransBot

Hello, this is my project on Pycord. In this read me, I will instruct you, how to set it up on your computer.

For this you will need:

- A discord bot
- Python
- and Py-cord installed

Let's get started by creating a bot.
First, go to [Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), login and then click the "New application" blue button
